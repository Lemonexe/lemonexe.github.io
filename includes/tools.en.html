	Here is a list of various interesting projects, that I want to share – programs or documents.

	<li>
		<a href="content/UUC/">Ultimate Unit Converter</a> 🛠<br>
		Productivity tool for science & engineering – you can find a lot of unit converters on the internet, but I've always wished for an option to convert complicated units (units composed as a product of more units with different powers, e.g. m<sup>6</sup>·Pa/mol<sup>2</sup>),
		so I created this converter, which can convert any unit to any other, break them down to basic SI, and perform simple calculations as well.<br>
		Also includes up-to-date currency exchange rates.<br>
		Available in English and Czech language.
	</li>

	<li>
		<a href="https://github.com/Lemonexe/VLizard">VLizard, a VLE wizard</a>🧙‍⚗🦎<br>
		A free open-source application for advanced processing of VLE <i>(vapor-liquid equilibrium)</i> data, which comprises some well-known tests of thermodynamic consistency, as well as basic model fitting capabilities.<br>
		With an intuitive graphical interface it can be easily used by scientists who are not used to programming.
	</li>

	<li>
		<a href="download/kucharka-export.pdf" target="_blank">Operational manual for kitchen</a> 😋🧪 <b>CZ only</b><br>
		A chemical engineer's cookbook. Optimized for a most horrible culinary experience.
	</li>

	<li>
		<a href="download/cheming-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">Cheming cheatsheet</a> 🎓<br>
		Cheatsheet with essential chemical engineering formulae for practical applications.
	</li>

	<li>
		<a href="download/FCh-cheatsheet.pdf" target="_blank">FCh cheatsheet</a> 🎓<br>
		Cheatsheet with essential physical chemistry (thermodynamics) formulae incl. how to derive them.
	</li>

	<li>
		<a href="download/Chartizard.xlam.zip">Chartizard</a>, a chart wizard <i>(last version 11-03-2023)</i><br>
		xlam addon for Excel which provides extra functionality to automate working with charts.<br>
		💡  Do you also find it a bit tedious to edit ten charts by clicking through tabs and windows <i>in&nbsp;every&nbsp;one&nbsp;of&nbsp;them</i>?
		Well, Chartizard does that for you – you can manage multiple charts at once by writing <i>functions</i>, which you can copy around and execute all at once.
		This way you can dynamically assign data series, set axis bounds, titles and much more.
		Contains interactive tutorial.<br>
		<i>If you don't have rights to install the addon on your computer, you can use the "portable" <a href="download/Chartizard.xlsm.zip">xlsm version.</a></i>
