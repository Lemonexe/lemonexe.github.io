	When I was a little kid in the year 2002, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Empires_II">Age of Empires II</a> was the first Windows game I tried to play. AoE2 will therefore always have a place in my heart and I keep coming back to it time from time.
</p>
<p>
	Besides playing the game itself I was amazed by the scenario editor, where I have spent a lot of time and I created dozens of maps. Most of them were literally unplayable and thus nobody played them except me, but that has never discouraged me! Eventually I became quite good at it, and now I offer you a few scenarios that I consider well done. I'll be glad if someone enjoys them :-)
</p>
<p><i>
	I only offer scenarios for HD Edition. If there are such veterans who still play original Conquerors or UserPatch 1.4, don't hesitate <a href="mailto:zbytek@gmail.com">writing me</a>, I might send you something from my vintage private reserve ;-)

<p>
	Unpack the downloaded file and follow the instructions in <code>_README.pdf</code>, because both scenarios are also mods with new units ✨
	There is a script to easily switch between the original game and the mod at any time.

		My most favorite RPG game, Gothic 2, is remade here as an AoE2 scenario – in this alternate story there is one deviation, which is why you control whole armies, not just the nameless hero.
		Recommended only if you know the original game, because the story is condensed considerably, so that you have a lot of time for carnage with orcs ;-)<br>
		Thanks to my own modification, the "dragons" now breath fire, mages cast offensive spells and the world is populated with scavengers, goblins and other critters, <a href="https://imgur.com/a/DxL6hve">see screenshots!</a>

		A long time ago I got the idea to create scenarios from 20th century in AoE2. That must sound pretty crazy, right, since there are other games set in that era... but I enjoyed it, and after many attempts I proudly present to you the first such scenario that I consider technically mature enough thanks to my own modification – machine guns finally operate like machine guns, artillery fire results in spectacular explosions and units are balanced.<br>
		Thematically inspired by the battle of Verdun – a symmetrical map focused on heavy siege of fortified positions, which will test your micro skills ;-)

		Are you familiar with the sci-fi universe Warhammer 40k? If you are, then don't hesitate and try this crossover of middle age and Warhammer, where you lead knights to defend your dominion (and thus the whole humanity) against an Ork invasion.
