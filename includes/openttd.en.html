	Here I offer you two maps for <a href="https://www.openttd.org/">OpenTTD</a> that I have created myself, as well as my favorite one which I didn't make, but is no longer downloadable. Recommended version at least 14.0
</p>

	All the maps listed here have one thing in common – a rough and diverse terrain. In my opinion, automatically generated maps offer too much open space and too few obstacles, so nothing prevents you to simply repeat the same patterns all over the map. The game quickly becomes boring when you don't have to improvise and solve new problems.

	<li>
		<a href="download/ottd/Alpine.scn" download>Alpine</a> (512<sup>2</sup>, October 2018)<br>
		Loosely inspired by southern Alps and northern Italy.<br>
		In these Alps, however, coal, oil and iron ore is mined, and the higher you go, the more abundant they are.
		On the other hand, most of the industry is concentrated in the lowlands, so you'll have to funnel trains from all corners of the map through narrow valleys, choose a compromise between elevation and length, and finally build complex, high-flow interchanges in confined spaces.<br>

		<a href="download/ottd/Apennines.scn" download>Apennines</a> (128<sup>2</sup>, July 2019)<br>
		Tiny bonsai map as a small taster from the monumental Alpine.<br>
		Great choice for those who prefer relaxing rather than technical gameplay :-)<br>

	<li>
		<a href="download/ottd/Dinora Islands.scn" download>Dinora Islands</a> (256<sup>2</sup>, created by Michael "Bot_40" Rippon)<br>
		This map was one of the first I ever played and I consider it to be excellent – it is well balanced and the difficulty is just right for a beginner.<br>
		Dinora Islands is a jagged archipelago, where you'll have to choose the right positions for bridges, while inland hills force you to save space. Thanks to the diverse terrain you are guaranteed to have lots of fun despite its small size.<br>
