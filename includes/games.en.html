	It has long been my passion to create JavaScript browser games.
	I have created dozens, though most of are either unfinished, or just really bad due to my poor skills back then xD<br>
	Here I present to you those I consider well-done.
	Sorted from latest to oldest, some of them are in Czech only:

			<a href="content/Felda/">Felda simulator</a> <b>CZ only</b>
			<i>(August 2017 – January 2020)</i><br>
			In Felda Simulator you can finally sit behind the <s>wheel</s> pedals and gearstick of the well-known Czech car, Škoda Felicia (and other cars as well).<br>
			The most entertaining physical simulation of all time is based <i>mostly</i> on real data and comprises physical model of engine, transmission and clutch, which you can control and thus observe behavior of car including its fuel consumption, or just admire the countryside as it flies by!

		<a href="content/UkradyjamHD/">Ukradyjam: HD edition</a> <b>CZ only</b>
		<i>(May 2019 – May 2021)</i><br>
		Dive into beer-soaked politics of ancient Greece in the best building strategy ever!<br>
		Raise up your empire from mud and dust towards a sophisticated technologic utopia in this simulator of antic imperialism, which parodies a well-known online game.
		Although Ukradyjam is not online and you can only interact with the environment, I believe it will still offer you lots of fun!

			PWN 2
			<i>(July 2016 – ???)</i><br>
			The year 2016 has given us a new inspiration for this ancient project.
			PWN 2 will be published <i>soon</i><sup>&trade;</sup>, changed beyond all recognition!
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="content/PWN/">PWN 1 (demo)</a>
			<i>(September 2011 – October 2013)</i><br>
			Fullscreen strongly recommended.<br>
			An ambitious project in cooperation with Martin Mach, in which you take the role of Chosen Hero and save the Kingdom.
			The first Massive Singleplayer Offline Role Pwning Game! The best RPG in the world!<br>
			Though will be forever left as a functional demoversion with almost no game content.
		</li>

		<li>
			<a href="content/dracak/dracak.html">HTML Dračák</a> <b>CZ only</b>
			<i>(November 2007)</i><br>
			My first game ever made, inspired by Dungeons & Dragons, where you traverse a labyrinthine web of hyperlinks, which form a dangerous fantasy world, where you can die at any corner.
			Some parts may be broken due to later experimenting with framesets.
			Surely a <a href="content/dracak/mapa.jpg">map</a> will come in handy.<br>
			Later on I attempted many times to remake & enhance Dračák, which then led to the PWN project.
